Movie Application Overview:

The Movie Application is a web-based movie discovery platform that allows users to search for and explore various movies based on different genres. It provides a visually appealing interface where users can discover popular movies, view movie details, and watch embedded trailers. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the TMDB API to fetch movie data.

Key Features:

----> Popular Movies Display: The homepage of the application displays a list of popular movies sorted by popularity. Each movie is represented as a card, showing its title, poster image, and average vote rating. The cards are color-coded to indicate the overall rating of the movie (green for high ratings, orange for moderate, and red for low).

----> Genre Filtering: Users can explore movies by selecting specific genres. The application provides a list of genres as tags, and users can click on these tags to filter movies based on their preferences. Multiple genres can be selected simultaneously to narrow down the search results.

----> Search Functionality: The application offers a search bar where users can enter the title of a movie they are interested in. Upon submitting the search query, the app fetches movies that match the entered search term and displays the results. The search can be combined with genre filtering for more refined results.

----> Pagination: The movie list is paginated, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of results. The application displays the current page number, and users can use the previous and next buttons to browse through different pages of movies.

----> Movie Details and Trailers: When a user clicks on the "Know More" button on a movie card, an overlay is displayed with additional information about the movie, including its title, overview, and embedded YouTube trailer (if available). Users can watch the trailer and get a quick overview of the movie's content.

==> User Interaction:

---->  Movie Exploration: Users can explore the popular movies displayed on the homepage. They can scroll through the list of movie cards and view basic details like title and rating.

-----> Genre Selection: Users can click on the genre tags to filter movies by specific genres. The application dynamically updates the movie list based on the selected genres.

---->  Search Movies: Users can search for specific movies using the search bar. Upon submitting the search query, relevant movies matching the title are displayed.

---->  Pagination Navigation: Users can use the previous and next buttons to navigate through different pages of movie results when the number of movies exceeds the page limit.

-----> View Movie Details and Trailers: By clicking the "Know More" button on a movie card, users can access additional information about the movie, such as an overview and embedded trailer. The overlay provides a smooth user experience to watch the trailers directly within the application.
